\arguments{
\item{...}{content to include in the grid stack item}

\item{id}{the id of the item, used for save and load functions, this param is propagated through to lower levels}

\item{auto_position}{if set to TRUE x and y attributes are ignored and the element is placed to the first
available position. Having either x or y missing will also do that}

\item{x, y}{element position in columns/rows.
Note: if one is missing this will \code{auto_position} the item}

\item{w, h}{element size in columns/rows}

\item{max_w, min_w, max_h, min_h}{element constraints in column/row (default none)}

\item{locked}{means another widget wouldn't be able to move it during dragging or resizing.
The widget can still be dragged or resized by the user.
You need to add \code{no_resize} and \code{no_move} attributes to completely lock the widget.}

\item{no_resize}{if set to TRUE it disables element resizing}

\item{no_move}{if set to TRUE it disables element moving}

\item{resize_handles}{- widgets can have their own custom resize handles.
For example 'e,w' will make that particular widget only resize east and west.}
}
\value{
a grid_stack_item to be placed inside a \code{grid_stack}. This item is resizable and draggable by default.
}
